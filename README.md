# WorkFlow

This is a team project developed for the Software Engineering class (COMP 350).  
It was originally managed under a school GitHub repository in collaboration with my teammates, and is now moved to my personal GitHub account for personal archiving and demonstration purposes.

**Contributors:**
- Jason Rincon
- Kathleen Robbins
- Heriberto Y Hernandez
- Steve Coyotl

**Note:**
This repository currently includes a single full commit representing the complete project as it existed on the school repository. Ongoing development and commit history were done under the school-managed account.
